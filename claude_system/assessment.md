## Verdict
tDelta is conceptually valid and differentiated.

## Why It Works
- aligns with commitment device research
- visual time makes delay concrete
- voluntary friction preserves agency

## What’s Novel
- persistent under-tab bar
- t-minus / t-plus framing
- accountability without moralizing

## Biggest Risk
activation friction  
students avoid committing

## Mitigation
- short first sessions
- immediate visual payoff
- stats shown early

## Behavioral Fit
good for:
- motivated but distracted students
- assignment-driven work

bad for:
- users avoiding discomfort entirely

## Recommendation
build V1 exactly as scoped  
validate activation + retention before expanding
